Welcome to the OpenStack 101 Workshop.

This workshop aimed to provide a quick crash-course in OpenStack as an end user.

In this workshop you will:
* Look around
* Create a basic network (including subnets and routers)
* Create a basic instance (Virtual Machine)
* Create a more functional instance
* Create a working template, with load balanced workload

OpenStack has a nice web user interface called [Horizon](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/).  However, the real power in OpenStack comes from *automation*, and being effective on the command-line brings you a long way towards automating Stack.

This lab will therefore focus on driving OpenStack from the command-line.

To complete this workshop you will need:
* A web browser (to view these instructions)
* An ssh client (eg. Putty)
* A basic familiarity with the Linux command line
